    //Create a page that displays a list of People (or whatever interests you).
    //On top of the page, have a link that says "Add Person". When this link
    //is clicked, the user should be taken to a page that has a form that 
    //has textboxes for firstname/lastname/age (or whatever thing you're doing).
    //Beneath that, there should be a submit button. When the button is clicked,
    //the person should get added to the database, and the user should be redirected
    //back to the list of all the people.

    //Second exercise:

    //Add a column to your table called "Delete". In each row of the table, there
    //should be a delete button, that when clicked, will delete that person from the
    //database, and redirect the user back to the page that shows a list of all people.
    //The way to achieve this is to embed each Delete button in a form that posts
    //to an Action on your controller that will delete that person. Inside that form,
    //also have a hidden input with the id of that person. Then, in your controller,
    //take that id in as a parameter, delete that person, and then redirect back to
    //the list page.

    //<input type="hidden" name="id" value="some id" />
